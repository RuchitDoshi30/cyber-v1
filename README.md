# Cyber Forensics Investigation Dashboard

A web-based frontend application designed to simulate a cyber forensics investigation system.

This project focuses on **visualizing, investigating, and reporting cyber logs** collected from multiple sources such as operating systems, applications, servers, and IoT devices.

The application is **frontend-focused** and demonstrates the investigation workflow rather than backend or machine learning implementation.

## 🎯 Project Objectives 

- Provide a clean dashboard for cyber forensics investigations
- Allow log upload and inspection
- Enable searching, filtering, and investigation of logs
- Visually represent anomalies and correlated events
- Generate investigation reports in multiple formats
- Demonstrate explainable AI concepts through UI (not actual AI)

---

## 🧠 Key Principles

- Frontend-first implementation
- Static or dummy data is acceptable
- No real machine learning models
- No real backend APIs required
- Focus on usability, clarity, and investigation workflow

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack (Recommended)

- HTML
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS or Material UI
- Charting library (Chart.js)
- Dummy JSON data for logs

---

## 🚫 Out of Scope

- Backend services or databases
- Real log parsing or ingestion logic
- Real AI / ML / NLP implementation
- Authentication or authorization systems
- Production-grade security enforcement

---

## 📁 Project Structure (High Level)

- Pages for each investigation stage
- Reusable UI components
- Dummy data models
- Clear separation of concerns

---

## 📌 Notes for Evaluators

This project demonstrates:
- Cyber forensics investigation workflow
- Log analysis mindset
- Data visualization and reporting
- Explainable AI concepts via UI representation

The emphasis is on **how investigators interact with data**, not on backend computation.
